## Our Story

**Benedicta and Sonnie's Tears and Pains** is a charity dedicated to offering aid and empowerment to abused and overlooked widows. Our mission encompasses not only
assisting these women in need but also supporting religious activities through the construction of churches in communities lacking access to places of worship.

My mission is to advocate for Ghanaian surviving spouses' access to their late husband's Death Certificates, enabling them to claim what is rightfully theirs.
The lack of legal protection in the Ghana Law Reports leaves widows vulnerable to mistreatment from extended family members, as my son and I experienced
firsthand. Benedicta and Sonnies Tears and Pains Charity aims to support abused and neglected widows in Ghana facing challenges in meeting their basic needs,
such as lack of skills, education, and financial resources. These widows lack proper housing and live in squalid conditions, some even requesting boreholes and
churches for their communities. The widows supported by Benedicta and Sonnies Tears and Pains Charity hail from various regions in Ghana, including the Volta,
Greater Accra, Eastern, Central, Brong Ahafo, and Ashanti regions. Many of these widows face health issues, depression, sadness, worry, and low spirits. Through
the Widow and Son Program, I had the privilege of meeting 240 widows, with an additional 60 expressing their desire to join but unable to do so due to financial
constraints. As a Ghanaian widow who endured challenges and hostilities from my late husband's family, preventing me from participating in his final burial
rites, I empathize deeply with these suffering widows.

My primary objective is to ensure that Ghanaian surviving spouses have access to their late husband's Death Certificates, granting them the rightful
entitlements they deserve. Sadly, the Ghana Bar Association lacks laws in the Ghana Law Reports that safeguard surviving spouses from brutal attacks by the
deceased's extended family members. This gap in legal protection led to my son and me facing the wrath of my late husband's family. The United States of America
has played a crucial role in our lives, and we are grateful for their support. May God bless America, and may all glory be to the Almighty God. Amen and Amen.
